Basically he said that because human beings are each on their own in a state of nature, without any authority to protect them, it\u2019s really important to create some kind of social structure, and that\u2019s what the social contract is for.  He saw that \u201chumans live together\u201d in the quote above, and by creating laws and government and government officials to enforce laws and agreements, society\u2019s members will, in effect, create this binding contract to protect and provide for each other.  He said the consent of the governed is the source of all political power, which is pretty easy to agree with since it seems logical to me that people who actually live in a society can better decide how to run their society than a random group of people who don\u2019t actually live in that society.  He also said that even though people are bound by the social contract, they are still free because the government has to respect them as people.  That said, the fact that a government can enforce laws pretty much means that the government has power, and government leaders have more power than others, so it\u2019s not really possible for everyone to be equal.

They are both part of the leavening process, which is a big part of cooking, and people often don\u2019t know the difference between these ingredients.  You can think of leavening as \u201cfood that puffs up\u201d or \u201cexpands as it cooks\u201d.  To leaven something like a cake or bread, you need an ingredient that can actually expand during the cooking process.  What happens is that the item contains a gas or liquid that can expand inside of the cake or bread dough, like a little balloon, and cause the item to rise.  \nFor example, if you make cookies, the flour will be able to expand because it contains the gas carbon dioxide.  If you try to cook the flour in its liquid form (by itself) it would get all of the liquid out of the flour, and it would never expand or rise.  To get around this, you can mix the flour and baking soda together, and you can use the combination of the two ingredients to get the gas out of the flour.  Then, the gas from the baking soda can expand and lift the cookie.  Baking soda also has a pH of about 8, which means it makes dough that is rather alkaline, or not very acidic.  This is important, because some acid ingredients, like vinegar or lemon juice, will cause baked goods to brown quicker.\n@@@ Rephrase: ", "chosen": " "}

{"prompt": "Please rephrase the following sentence: \n@@@ Original Sentence: It's recommended that rats live in an enclosure rather than be allowed to roam freely.  There are two types of rat cages:  a solid enclosure or a wire one.\n\nWire enclosures are great because they allow you to make a large number of different enclosures to allow for foraging and play, and even open the door for a break in the day.  Wire cages don\u2019t provide them with the high-space area they prefer, so you can use the floor and walls to keep them interested.  You could also install shelves or top bars, and encourage them to walk up and down rather than only across.\n\nSolid enclosures are less interesting to them, but they'll be less active in a solid enclosure, which means they'll use it less, and they can't break it up and use it to climb out.  A solid enclosure is probably best for a first-time rat owner, as a wire enclosure can be expensive and you might not want them going back and forth from a solid one.\n\nAs far as food goes, you can feed them a wide variety of foods, ranging from just plain wheat, to rabbit or hamster kibble, to sunflower seeds, and pretty much anything you might want to eat.  Rats are omnivores like us, so you'll want to feed them a diet of healthy fats, proteins, carbohydrates, and vegetables.  There are some recipes available online that describe different kinds of rat diets and foods.  You can also buy pre-made rat food.\n\nWhat I think you're asking about is the area they'll use for their bathroom and when they need to get out.  This depends on the type of cage and type of animal.  Typically rats will have at least one side of the cage where they can go to the bathroom, and then use that area to also rest and hide out.  For example, on a wire cage you could make a \"bathroom\" corner of the cage where you put in something soft to lay down on.  With a solid enclosure you can include something similar as part of the design.\n\nPlease let me know if this helps, or if you have any more questions!\n@@@ Rephrase: ", "chosen": " "}

{"prompt": "Please rephrase the following sentence: \n@@@ Original Sentence: The number of representatives for the Senate is the result of two political compromises.  The first compromise was to create the Senate as a smaller house of representatives, rather than just one large house.  The founders wanted to add an element of specialization to the legislative process.  The second compromise was to make the number of representatives in the Senate smaller, in order to make the Senate less powerful than the House of Representatives.  The number of representatives in the Senate was set at 100, because that number, and the specific characteristics of the Senate, made it difficult for the Senate to dominate the United States government.  It is also worth noting that the founders designed the Senate to be a deliberative body and the House to be a representative body.\n@@@ Rephrase: ", "chosen": " "}
