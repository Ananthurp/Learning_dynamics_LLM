The Puritans observed the Sabbath on Sunday, and the Puritans only had a small influence in the early history of the USA.  It\u2019s difficult to trace the origins of closing stores on Sunday, but one early and short-lived attempt at forcing the Sabbath on people in the 1800s was motivated by the Protestant ideal that people should spend Sunday focusing on spiritual activities.  By the mid-1800s, when the Sunday closing law was made, there was not a lot of pressure from that standpoint, but the church had begun to advocate for Sunday closing laws as a way of counteracting the negative effects of industrialization on the day of rest.  Even after that shift, closing stores on Sunday was not always possible, since the religious Sunday was not always chosen for observance.  And as industrialization accelerated and mechanization made it possible to operate stores on Sunday, the law was not enforced as much as people liked.  The day of rest was also being violated by stores that stayed open all day on Sunday, so closing stores on Sundays became an effort to protect the Sabbath for all citizens.\n@@@ Rephrase: ", "chosen": " "}

What I\u2019m thinking of is the way that our imagination works.\n\nImagine you had a thin sheet of flexible plastic which could be pulled out from a roll to become a long tube, about 100m long.  We call this a \u201cwormhole\u201d, as in, it\u2019s a flexible wormhole.  If you were floating in space, and grabbed one end of it and held it, then the other end would stretch to the ground, into the ground and back out again.  If you stood on the ground, you could then pull it and have it lift you up into the air.  The question is, could the Earth rotate under the \u201cwormhole\u201d while the person holding it was \u201cin the air\u201d?\n\nThe answer is, no.  The \u201cwormhole\u201d analogy is a bit strange, so let me explain it more carefully.\n\nI think when you are floating above the ground, you are also moving around it.  But in the same way that you can hold one end of the wormhole while floating, the Earth is also moving around you.  So you might wonder how it could \u201crotate\u201d while you are also moving around it.\n\nThis is a situation of accelerating motion.  A spaceship, say, accelerates around the Earth so that it is moving at a speed which is near the speed of light.  As it flies past, we say it moves \u201cfaster than light\u201d and we call this \u201ctachyonic motion\u201d or \u201ctachyons\u201d for short.  Tachyons are things that accelerate faster than light, and as they pass by, objects may seem to move or \u201crotate\u201d as they pass, even though the objects themselves are not moving.\n\nI hope this answer has helped to clarify how we can still see the Earth rotating even if it is also accelerating in the other direction.

The details of the case showed that the killer had a very serious and long-standing alcohol addiction. Public opinion at the time of the trial favored the idea that the killer was a killer-not a drunk, but an individual who did not do what he did through willpower and determination, but instead, due to the weakness and inability to control his alcohol consumption.

{"prompt": "Please rephrase the following sentence: \n@@@ Original Sentence: One way to think about it is this:  You can make a car without a human driver in two different ways.  The first is to put a robot in the car, which is kind of like a remote-control helicopter.  The robot would have a video camera, some artificial intelligence, and some sensors.  When you are driving, you would be able to see out the window and steer and accelerate and brake with a joystick or other controls, so it\u2019s like you are driving, but you aren\u2019t.  You\u2019d control the robot, and the robot would control the car.  If you wanted to be super safe, you could build an extra sensor in the car that would only drive in the safest conditions, and when there were hazards, or if the car sensed the driver wasn\u2019t doing what they should, then the robot would actually take over control of the car and drive it instead.  This is the safer way, but it would also be kind of slow because the robot would just be doing the exact same thing that you would have done, and if you messed up, the robot would also mess up.\n\nThe other way is to give your car a super powerful computer, with artificial intelligence, and a pretty fast internet connection, and let it drive itself.  This car would also have some sensors, but it wouldn\u2019t really need them, because it would always have access to so much more information than you do.  When you are driving, you would choose where you want to go, and your car would use all of its data to come up with the best route and way to get there.  The computer would make all the decisions about how to handle unexpected events and road conditions, and would do the braking and steering and everything.  It\u2019s kind of like having a flying car that is in control of everything, and you just decide where you want to go.  Most people use cars like this, because they\u2019re pretty good and most of the time you don\u2019t really want to do all of that work and risking making a mistake.\n@@@ Rephrase: ", "chosen": " "}
