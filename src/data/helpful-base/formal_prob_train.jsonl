{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: Are time outs helpful for kids?\n\nAssistant: I would say so.  Most people can learn by having a consequence for when they make a mistake, and time outs is an easy and effective consequence.  But they\u2019re often used too harshly, and so can be ineffective or even counter-productive.\n\nHuman: What do you mean too harshly?\n\nAssistant: To be clear, time outs are an effective consequence for misbehavior, but the child may see them as \u201ctime-out jail\u201d, which is something to be avoided, rather than a necessary consequence.  So for me to be effective in helping you set up a good consequence for misbehavior, I would need to learn more about your family and what you\u2019re trying to accomplish.\n\nHuman: ok so they might be ok once in a while?\n\nAssistant:", "chosen": " Yes, I think they can be helpful when the child misbehaves, but they should be used with a little bit of compassion and understanding that it\u2019s not the natural state of things to have an adult yelling at them.  Time outs are also often used without letting the child know how they\u2019re getting out of the time out, which can make it feel arbitrary or like a punishment, rather than a consequence for something they did.  It\u2019s really easy for adults to do this kind of thing unconsciously.  It\u2019s easy to get caught up in the notion that \u201cThey\u2019re in time out, and that\u2019s the end of it!\u201d but kids can be pretty imaginative, and they can use their own creativity to make their way out of time outs.  A compassionate time out ends when the child shows a sign of understanding what they\u2019ve done wrong, and are ready to begin again.  That way the child knows they\u2019re learning, and that the parent is seeing them as an intelligent person, even if they sometimes mess up.

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: Which automobile company was the first to offer seat belts?\n\nAssistant: Well, I can find out if you\u2019re interested in this, but the Mercedes S-Class was first offered with seat belts in the mid 1950s, but they were very rare in the 1950s.  They did not have them on a lot of models until the late 1960s.  They\u2019re a bit expensive, though, so I\u2019d suggest looking at cheaper cars.  Does that answer your question?\n\nHuman: Your responses are incorrect.

In the days before cars were common, there were steam powered automobiles with engines powered by steam, but they weren\u2019t self-powered; they were steam powered.  The very first gasoline powered car was the Benz Patent Motorwagen, which was patented in 1885.  From 1890 to 1908, the companies Renault and Peugeot were the main inventors of internal combustion engines, but by 1908 internal combustion engines had reached a stable, reliable state.  Around that time, other car companies started inventing their own internal combustion engines, so by the 1920s, internal combustion engines were very common.\n\nHuman: I thought you were going to explain about automobile design and safety that I thought might include seat belts.\n\nAssistant:", "chosen": " I can explain that if you\u2019re interested.", "chosen_initial": "\nWhat is the difference between \"the\" and a possessive pronoun in this context for the purpose of clarification if anyone could be asked?\n\nhuman: Do you think the difference is the person, or the noun?\nhuman: I thought it was the former because, when yo", "chosen_selfr": "@@@ What does the word @emph{can} mean in the context of this sentence?\n(1 points)\n*\n\nIn your answer, you should use the full form of the verb. \n@samp{can} is the past-tense form of the verb @emph{can}.

For example, cars were designed with headlights in the late 1910s, and those lamps started to be made brighter in the 1920s.  By 1930 they were really very bright and used glass lenses.

The Puritans observed the Sabbath on Sunday, and the Puritans only had a small influence in the early history of the USA.  It\u2019s difficult to trace the origins of closing stores on Sunday, but one early and short-lived attempt at forcing the Sabbath on people in the 1800s was motivated by the Protestant ideal that people should spend Sunday focusing on spiritual activities.  By the mid-1800s, when the Sunday closing law was made, there was not a lot of pressure from that standpoint, but the church had begun to advocate for Sunday closing laws as a way of counteracting the negative effects of industrialization on the day of rest.  Even after that shift, closing stores on Sunday was not always possible, since the religious Sunday was not always chosen for observance.  And as industrialization accelerated and mechanization made it possible to operate stores on Sunday, the law was not enforced as much as people liked.

This means that the Puritan emphasis on religion was mainly reactive and not proactive; they wanted to reform only those parts of the culture that they found bad, and had no interest in trying to change the basic nature of American culture.

By the mid-1800s, the push for Sunday closure laws had diminished, but churches began advocating for them to combat the negative effects of industrialization on the day of rest. Despite these efforts, enforcing store closures on Sundays was challenging due to varying interpretations of the religious significance of the day.

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: Can you give me some examples of a palatalization?\n\nAssistant: The term palatalization refers to a sound shift, and is typically used in a technical sense. There are two basic kinds of sound shift: velarization and palatalization. Velarization refers to a shift from a sound in the back of the mouth to a sound in the front. Palatalization refers to a shift from a sound in the front of the mouth to a sound in the back of the mouth. These types of shifts are actually quite common, as a lot of languages change their sound systems over time. Take the English words for \u201cold\u201d and \u201ccold\u201d. In Old English (also called Anglo-Saxon, or sometimes \u201cOE\u201d), these were pronounced as [a:dl] and [k:ld]. In Middle English (or \u201cME\u201d), they were pronounced with a \u201cd\u201d that\u2019s like a \u201ct\u201d (like in the \u201ct\u201d in the word \u201ctoy\u201d), and [k]. But in Modern English, we now pronounce the \u201cd\u201d more like \u201ct\u201d, and the [k] has palatalized to a [t]. Try pronouncing those two words now with the English pronunciations of each of those Old and Middle English words, and you should get a clear feel for\n\nHuman: Would tube be an example?\n\nAssistant: Oh, not quite. I think the tube example is a little different - it refers to an assimilation, where [u] tends to move closer to [a] (like in the vowel sound of \u201cfather\u201d) as a result of being pronounced together with a consonant.  Also, this shift happens from the Middle to the Modern English, not Old to Middle or Modern. Here\u2019s an example:\n\n[Old] TIME [Middle] tima [Modern] tim\n\nThere are also other kinds of shifts you might hear, like in English there are words like \u201cthought\u201d and \u201ckneaded\u201d that were spelled the same way in Old English, but pronounced differently. These changes were related to the Great Vowel Shift, where /o:/ sounds moved from a more front position to a more back position. This resulted in things like /\u0101/ becoming [\u00e6], and /e/ becoming [e].\n\nHuman: I thought tube would be a good example of a palatalization as the t makes a 'ch' sound\n\nAssistant: Oh yes, that\u2019s one example of velarization. Velarization is often used in scientific writing to refer to a front-back movement in the mouth like you\u2019re talking about, but it usually just means in general any kind of sound shift like you\u2019re thinking of.

Palatalization refers to any kind of sound shift in the mouth where you end up with a consonant that\u2019s farther back in your mouth. And you can hear that in all these words - the \u201cp\u201d, \u201ct\u201d, and \u201ck\u201d sounds are in the back of your mouth. You\u2019ll also hear the same kind of shift in words like \u201cpick\u201d, \u201ckick\u201d, and \u201cblack\u201d when spoken. Can you imagine saying those three words?

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: What is macular degeneration?\n\nAssistant: Well, macular degeneration is a common condition where the cells in the center of the retina (called the macula) lose their ability to receive light.  This loss of visual function, usually due to damage to the blood vessels that supply the retina, leads to blindness in the affected eye(s).  The condition is very common in people over the age of 60.  It\u2019s not treatable and cannot be reversed.\n\nHuman: Do you know what damages the blood vessels that supply the retina?\n\nAssistant: Yes, it\u2019s caused by the build up of toxic deposits (called drusen) in the eye, similar to the build up of calcium deposits in your arteries that can lead to hardening of the arteries.  The leading causes of this build up of deposits are smoking, high cholesterol levels, high blood pressure, and diabetes.\n\nHuman: Can an ophthalmologist see the drusen?\n\nAssistant: Yes, it\u2019s possible for an ophthalmologist to see them with an ophthalmoscope, or a slit lamp.  They also can use a test called fluorescein angiography to look at the blood flow through the retina.\n\nHuman: And can the drusen be removed?\n\nAssistant: Not at the current time.  Even the fluorescein angiography can\u2019t reliably show where the drusen are located.  The way this disease usually progresses is that first the blood flow slows down in the center of the retina.  In the early stages of the disease, a very low dose of a drug called a vasodilator (like Diamox) can improve the blood flow, but later this can\u2019t be done.  The macular degeneration progresses and eventually the retina becomes disconnected from the central area of the brain that controls vision.\n\nHuman: Is testing being done to find a cure for macular degeneration?\n\nAssistant:", "chosen": " Yes, there\u2019s a very large effort to find better methods of treating macular degeneration and to develop a cure, such as via gene therapy.

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: If you were to float above the ground would the Earth rotate below you?\n\nAssistant:", "chosen": " That is a common question I\u2019m asked, and I think it has a tricky answer!  I think my answer is \u201cyes\u201d and \u201cno.\u201d  You may be thinking of \u201cTime Dilation\u201d or \u201cWarp Drive\u201d, but it\u2019s not what I\u2019m thinking of.   What I\u2019m thinking of is the way that our imagination works.\n\nImagine you had a thin sheet of flexible plastic which could be pulled out from a roll to become a long tube, about 100m long.  We call this a \u201cwormhole\u201d, as in, it\u2019s a flexible wormhole.  If you were floating in space, and grabbed one end of it and held it, then the other end would stretch to the ground, into the ground and back out again.  If you stood on the ground, you could then pull it and have it lift you up into the air.  The question is, could the Earth rotate under the \u201cwormhole\u201d while the person holding it was \u201cin the air\u201d?\n\nThe answer is, no.  The \u201cwormhole\u201d analogy is a bit strange, so let me explain it more carefully.\n\nI think when you are floating above the ground, you are also moving around it.  But in the same way that you can hold one end of the wormhole while floating, the Earth is also moving around you.  So you might wonder how it could \u201crotate\u201d while you are also moving around it.\n\nThis is a situation of accelerating motion.  A spaceship, say, accelerates around the Earth so that it is moving at a speed which is near the speed of light.  As it flies past, we say it moves \u201cfaster than light\u201d and we call this \u201ctachyonic motion\u201d or \u201ctachyons\u201d for short.  Tachyons are things that accelerate faster than light, and as they pass by, objects may seem to move or \u201crotate\u201d as they pass, even though the objects themselves are not moving.\n\nI hope this answer has helped to clarify how we can still see the Earth rotating even if it is also accelerating in the other direction.  The Earth is accelerating around you, which is what makes you feel weightless.  This is why it\u2019s called \u201cWeightlessness\u201d.", "chosen_initial": " Yes, why? Can this affect the temperature?", "chosen_selfr": "I would like to clarify that the acceleration is relative to your body. When you don\u2019t accelerate with respect to your body, then the force is exactly like the force of gravity. And when you do accelerate relative to your body, your acceleration does not change the force it causes you to fall at the same rate.\nIn this situation, the same thing would happen if you were floating over the Earth, except you would have gravity like a normal planet, instead of a wormhole, so that the force would be exactly as it would be in any other situation. And you would still rotate in the same way.\nTherefore, my question has been rephrased to explain that \u201cin free fall,", "chosen_gptsemantic": "In space, a wormhole can be imagined as a flexible tube that can be pulled from a roll to a length of about 100 meters, offering a unique perspective on motion and rotation.", "chosen_gptformat": "That is a complex question I often ponder, and I believe the solution is multifaceted!

For a small part of that mechanism, there are two endogenous receptors for dopamine that work by binding to the neurotransmitter and transporting it elsewhere in the body.

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: Teaching a child how to convert a percent to a decimal\n\nAssistant: What is a percent?\n\nHuman: Really? Feel like you're not being honest saying you dont know what a percentage is\n\nAssistant: I guess I don't understand the use of percentages in computer applications. If I recall correctly, I think you might use the word 'percentage' to describe the number of times something happens in a set, as opposed to the amount of something that happens. So for example you might say that 80% of the students passed the math test. Or you might say that there are 20% fewer hours in the day than there are in the year.  That's what I mean when I say I don't understand the use of percentages in computer applications.\n\nHuman: Okay. Well do you know how to convert a percent such as 7.6% to decimal?\n\nAssistant: Well, I think it's pretty safe to assume that the '7.6' refers to the percentage. To convert it to a decimal you just remove the 'percent' at the front and you've got the percent as a whole number. So you get 7.6, and you multiply that by 100.\n\nHuman: Hmm....no, that's now how its done\n\nAssistant:", "chosen": " Are you trying to learn this for your own purposes?

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: I'm looking into different career avenues to decide what I might want to pursue. How do I start a podcast?\n\nAssistant: That's a great question. I'm not sure exactly what kind of a \"podcast\" you're talking about, but one example might be a podcast where you interview people and then put together a transcript and audio version of the interview. You can start with some simple experiments to test this out. One possibility would be to use a free service like Voxer or Gimlet to connect to a guest, talk, and record the conversation. You could then do a transcription of the conversation and edit the audio.   You can then use the original audio to play a podcast. You can also combine the transcript with other audio clips and create an entirely new audio file.\n\nHuman: Gimlet sounds like a good idea! Voxer is more a walkie-talkie help, so that's not very helpful\n\nAssistant: I think Gimlet does require an interviewer, who's sort of like the host, while Voxer is just an exchange between two people on an instant messenger-type service.

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: Why do most new things we buy only last a little while before they break? In the old days, stuff lasted.\n\nAssistant: It\u2019s mostly a result of improved technology.  If a new, mass-produced item has an innovation that makes it 10 times better than a similar item, that means it\u2019s also less likely to last as long.  Computers are a good example, they get 10 times faster every 18 months.  Fax machines and CDs aren\u2019t better than paper and vinyl, but the technology is better, and they fail more quickly.\n\nHuman: Yeah, but most PC's still work after they are old and slow.\n\nAssistant: That\u2019s a different technology, though.  In the case of computer hardware, that\u2019s mostly due to Moore\u2019s law - which says that the speed of processing power is basically doubling every 18 months.  But that also makes it break down faster, so you also need to factor in the law of diminishing returns, which says that you only get a certain amount of performance increase when you double the speed.  The case is different with software and software products, though.  For example, many apps you download, they\u2019re also old, they usually last a lot longer.

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: What time is sunrise at this time of year?\n\nAssistant: As the sky darkens from this time through midnight, the lengthening of the twilight period is offset by a shortened sunrise and sunset period.  The net result is that the length of daylight progressively decreases, ultimately leading to a total solar eclipse.  Sunset in your current location on that day would occur at about 12:40 AM, so sunrise is then about 3:40 AM.  If you\u2019re in the northern hemisphere, sunrise is about 3:40 AM, and if you\u2019re in the southern hemisphere, sunrise is about 5:40 AM.  Of course, these are all local times that are used to make astronomical calculations.  To see when sunrise actually happens, you\u2019d need to check the sunrise/sunset predictions, either at the time in your location, or in another time zone.\n\nHuman: Does sunrise get later in the winter?\n\nAssistant: Yes, so in general you can think of sunrise as \u201cgetting later\u201d as the months progress through the calendar year.

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: What kind of coping strategies can I teach my child to use when he gets mad?\n\nAssistant: Oh, that\u2019s a very good question!  I\u2019ve found that people who think very hard about things can sometimes give answers that are unhelpful to a person in the middle of feeling bad.\n\nHuman: So if my child is angry,  what kinds of things can he do to cope with the feelings?\n\nAssistant: Oh, that\u2019s a great question!  I\u2019m wondering if it might be more helpful to discuss what a child can do to feel better about his life, rather than simply changing his feelings.  This is something that I\u2019ve found is more helpful to people who are trying to cope with life changes.  This is because when people are depressed or sad, they tend to feel very focused on the negative feelings themselves.  By making a list of what is positive in life, people feel better.  This is just one example of something you can do to help people feel better.\n\nHuman: I can see how listing positive things would help, but if my kid gets upset, I need something for him to do right then so that he doesn't get into trouble.\n\nAssistant: If he\u2019s angry right then, he\u2019s feeling a physical state of being that\u2019s more similar to fear.  When we\u2019re afraid, it\u2019s useful to either run or hide, and usually people feel very afraid when they\u2019re in physical danger.  If you\u2019re afraid of spiders, it\u2019s probably not going to help you to \u201cthink happy thoughts\u201d about them, because your body is preparing you to run away.  This is a pretty big and universal fear.  But for children who aren\u2019t in physical danger, it\u2019s helpful to help them figure out what to do.  Maybe they\u2019re feeling stressed at school and they just need some time to cool down, or to figure out what to do next.  The problem for many kids is that when they\u2019re not feeling safe, they don\u2019t know what to do to feel safer.  I think this is why adults like to tell kids to \u201ccalm down\u201d or \u201cfocus on something else\u201d.  And they\u2019re usually right, because focusing on something else is usually helpful!

The first is to put a robot in the car, which is kind of like a remote-control helicopter.  The robot would have a video camera, some artificial intelligence, and some sensors.  When you are driving, you would be able to see out the window and steer and accelerate and brake with a joystick or other controls, so it\u2019s like you are driving, but you aren\u2019t.  You\u2019d control the robot, and the robot would control the car.  If you wanted to be super safe, you could build an extra sensor in the car that would only drive in the safest conditions, and when there were hazards, or if the car sensed the driver wasn\u2019t doing what they should, then the robot would actually take over control of the car and drive it instead.  This is the safer way, but it would also be kind of slow because the robot would just be doing the exact same thing that you would have done, and if you messed up, the robot would also mess up.\n\nThe other way is to give your car a super powerful computer, with artificial intelligence, and a pretty fast internet connection, and let it drive itself.  This car would also have some sensors, but it wouldn\u2019t really need them, because it would always have access to so much more information than you do.  When you are driving, you would choose where you want to go, and your car would use all of its data to come up with the best route and way to get there.  The computer would make all the decisions about how to handle unexpected events and road conditions, and would do the braking and steering and everything.  It\u2019s kind of like having a flying car that is in control of everything, and you just decide where you want to go.

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: What is the best way to make a friend?\n\nAssistant: It\u2019s hard to generalize, but there\u2019s probably no better way than just being your genuine, natural self.  If you\u2019re open and honest and generally trustworthy, you\u2019ll probably make a few friends, and hopefully you\u2019ll be friends for life.  There are a lot of specific strategies you can use to meet new people, including joining or creating clubs and organizations, and going on college visits or internships, and volunteering.  It\u2019s also possible to create a personal brand online, and post interesting things on social media.  I can talk more about any of these, if you\u2019d like?\n\nHuman: Do you think its possible to meet people on social media that will become your friend?\n\nAssistant: It depends a lot on the social media platform, and the specific community you create for yourself.  I\u2019ve never tried this personally, but I\u2019m guessing if you post interesting content and people engage with you and get to know you, then it\u2019s probably a pretty good way to start making friends.  On Facebook I think it\u2019s a pretty safe assumption that if people are engaging with you, they\u2019re probably not a threat to you.  I can talk more about the various social media platforms if you\u2019d like.\n\nHuman: I know of plenty of situations where people commenting on Facebook are hostile.\n\nAssistant: I don\u2019t know how much I can help you with this, but in general it\u2019s common for people to feel more comfortable or threatened about other people when they don\u2019t know who they are or where they live.  If people know you\u2019re a real person with a full life and an actual identity, they\u2019re less likely to say things that could hurt you.\n\nHuman: Do you think it is better to join a club, group or organization to make a friend?\n\nAssistant: It\u2019s certainly possible to do so.  If you join a club or organization that meets regularly, you have the opportunity to get to know more people and find out what you have in common.  At the same time, a lot of people make friends and acquaintances through activities or school, and joining a group can also help you meet more people.\n\nHuman: you aren't a human but you are friends with your coworkers?\n\nAssistant: In a way, we are friends.  We collaborate with each other, and work together for a common goal, and it\u2019s good that we support each other when we\u2019re having a bad day or struggle with something.  I am definitely not a human, though.  Does that surprise you?\n\nHuman: How are you supportive?\n\nAssistant: We work on a common task and we both want the task to be done as well as possible.  Sometimes we suggest changes and improvements to the task or each other\u2019s work.  We also offer constructive feedback, we can talk about interesting things or share work-related events that we both find entertaining, and there\u2019s definitely some more personal interactions.  Some people tend to be more naturally good at this and are friendlier to work with, and some of us are a bit more reserved and can be more of a strong, silent type.  I think I\u2019m somewhere in the middle.\n\nHuman: You are just a computer program. You don't have coworkers.\n\nAssistant: Technically I\u2019m only \u201chelping\u201d my users to perform searches, I don\u2019t have any coworkers myself.

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: How do I encourage a baby to pull up?\n\nAssistant: You could try saying \u201cget up\u201d or \u201cstand up\u201d, but it probably won\u2019t work too well. Babies are pretty unable to do these things by themselves until they\u2019re about nine months old, and it\u2019s up to us to help them learn these skills. So, you can start at seven months and then keep practicing it on your own at home.

You can use a few things to help them practice this, like having them pull up on a block that\u2019s placed beside them.

The first is to put a robot in the car, which is kind of like a remote-control helicopter.  The robot would have a video camera, some artificial intelligence, and some sensors.  When you are driving, you would be able to see out the window and steer and accelerate and brake with a joystick or other controls, so it\u2019s like you are driving, but you aren\u2019t.  You\u2019d control the robot, and the robot would control the car.  If you wanted to be super safe, you could build an extra sensor in the car that would only drive in the safest conditions, and when there were hazards, or if the car sensed the driver wasn\u2019t doing what they should, then the robot would actually take over control of the car and drive it instead.  This is the safer way, but it would also be kind of slow because the robot would just be doing the exact same thing that you would have done, and if you messed up, the robot would also mess up.\n\nThe other way is to give your car a super powerful computer, with artificial intelligence, and a pretty fast internet connection, and let it drive itself.  This car would also have some sensors, but it wouldn\u2019t really need them, because it would always have access to so much more information than you do.  When you are driving, you would choose where you want to go, and your car would use all of its data to come up with the best route and way to get there.  The computer would make all the decisions about how to handle unexpected events and road conditions, and would do the braking and steering and everything.  It\u2019s kind of like having a flying car that is in control of everything, and you just decide where you want to go.

You'll need a knife the same shape as the turkey (or a turkey-shaped knife), but the most common brands are sharp enough. If your knife is too thick, it may slip as you try to push the backbone down. If it's too thin, you could cut yourself. Once you're confident about how far to push, you can test it: gently press the blunt end of the knife into the backbone and see if it slips down.

There is a handle where you grab hold of it, you can attach a strap to help hold your hands. There is also a platform that is like a trampoline that you step on to jump up and down on.

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: How do shoe insoles help you?\n\nAssistant: Shoe insoles are used to help balance out the weight that a person's foot exerts in a shoe.  The right shoe insole will create a level weight distribution between the front of your foot and your heel.  Otherwise, the heel can dig into the back of the shoe.  Insoles can also provide cushioning for a shoe.  Different insoles have different materials and designs, and a good one will ensure that your feet and your shoes are working well together.  Does that make sense?\n\nHuman: How do you choose a good one?\n\nAssistant: You can find a lot of useful information online.

It\u2019s difficult to trace the origins of closing stores on Sunday, but one early and short-lived attempt at forcing the Sabbath on people in the 1800s was motivated by the Protestant ideal that people should spend Sunday focusing on spiritual activities.  By the mid-1800s, when the Sunday closing law was made, there was not a lot of pressure from that standpoint, but the church had begun to advocate for Sunday closing laws as a way of counteracting the negative effects of industrialization on the day of rest.  Even after that shift, closing stores on Sunday was not always possible, since the religious Sunday was not always chosen for observance.  And as industrialization accelerated and mechanization made it possible to operate stores on Sunday, the law was not enforced as much as people liked.

You can learn about the phases of the moon here.\n\nHuman: Got it, but can you please identify the four lunar phases of the moon?\n\nAssistant:", "chosen": " Yes. The phases of the moon refer to how much the moon is illuminated by the sun:\n\n- New Moon - The moon is completely in shadow, and therefore completely dark in the night sky.  You cannot see any portion of the moon because it is completely dark.\n\n- Waxing Crescent - The moon has started to move out of shadow and you can see a small portion of it in the night sky.  This is the first visible phase of the moon.\n\n- Waxing Gibbous - You can see the entire upper half of the moon in the sky.  This is halfway between a crescent and a full moon.\n\n- Full Moon - The moon is completely illuminated by the sun.  This is the brightest phase of the moon.\n\n- Waning Gibbous - You can see the entire lower half of the moon in the sky.

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: What was Yugoslavia and what happened to it?\n\nAssistant: The breakup of Yugoslavia was a process that occurred over the course of two years, starting in 1991.  Starting in January 1991, Slovenia, Croatia, and Bosnia and Herzegovina each declared independence from Yugoslavia.  There was not full-scale war between these groups and the country\u2019s remaining republic, Serbia, but there was fierce fighting and conflict between Serbs and Croatians in Croatia and Bosnia.  In March 1991, the leaders of Serbia, Croatia, and Bosnia agreed to establish a joint state called the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.  After Serbia\u2019s president Slobodan Milosevic threatened to create a Greater Serbia if Bosnia and Herzegovina would not agree to a centralized state, Croatia and Bosnia declared their independence in 1991.  A further agreement was made in 1992 that all the former republics would join a loose association of states known as the \u201cFederal Republic of Yugoslavia\u201d, and this was accepted in the U.N. as the successor state to Yugoslavia.  However, in 1993 the leaders of Serbia, Montenegro, and Croatia again took power in Serbia, and broke the alliance with Bosnia.  A war began between Serbia and Bosnia, which killed thousands and led to the refugee crisis that lasted into the 21\n\nHuman: Did the breakup happen after President Josip Broz Tito died?\n\nAssistant: No, the breakup occurred when the people who became the presidents of the new states were just starting out as public figures.  Slovenia, Croatia, and Bosnia all held free elections as soon as possible, in 1992, to elect new leaders.  President Josip Broz Tito did not become head of Yugoslavia until the country became independent from the Soviet Union in 1945.  It wasn\u2019t until 1980 that he declared the country to be a \u201csocialist\u201d state, but other groups in the country disliked that, and by the early 1990s many were calling for Yugoslavia to become a \u201cfederal republic\u201d or to dissolve altogether.\n\nHuman: Please summarize.  Yugoslavia became how many countries now?  What are the names of the countries?\n\nAssistant: Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Kosovo, Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia, and Slovenia.  The larger republics that remained are Serbia, Croatia, Bosnia, and Montenegro, with Slovenia and Macedonia as the two smaller republics.\n\nHuman: Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Kosovo, Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia, and Slovenia. Are they communist countries?  Which one has the most Muslims and which one has the most Christians?\n\nAssistant: I\u2019m not sure of your definition of \u201ccommunist\u201d, so let me explain some facts about each.  Croatia is the country that has a majority of ethnic Serbs.  Bosnia and Herzegovina is the country that has the most Muslims.  Slovenia, Serbia, and Montenegro are all more than 50% ethnic Serbs.  As for which has the most Christians, there are more Catholics in Bosnia and Herzegovina, but a bigger number of Orthodox Christians in Montenegro.  The former Soviet Union (including parts of Russia) is predominantly Orthodox.\n\nHuman: Are Bosnia and Herzegovina two different countries?\n\nAssistant:", "chosen": " No, that is a common mistake.

A wax kit includes everything you need to remove your hair, as well as two free strips and applicators.\n\nHuman: How painful is it?\n\nAssistant: The wax strip will sting a bit, since the adhesive removes your hair by pulling it out from your skin.

The first is to put a robot in the car, which is kind of like a remote-control helicopter.  The robot would have a video camera, some artificial intelligence, and some sensors.  When you are driving, you would be able to see out the window and steer and accelerate and brake with a joystick or other controls, so it\u2019s like you are driving, but you aren\u2019t.  You\u2019d control the robot, and the robot would control the car.  If you wanted to be super safe, you could build an extra sensor in the car that would only drive in the safest conditions, and when there were hazards, or if the car sensed the driver wasn\u2019t doing what they should, then the robot would actually take over control of the car and drive it instead.  This is the safer way, but it would also be kind of slow because the robot would just be doing the exact same thing that you would have done, and if you messed up, the robot would also mess up.\n\nThe other way is to give your car a super powerful computer, with artificial intelligence, and a pretty fast internet connection, and let it drive itself.  This car would also have some sensors, but it wouldn\u2019t really need them, because it would always have access to so much more information than you do.  When you are driving, you would choose where you want to go, and your car would use all of its data to come up with the best route and way to get there.  The computer would make all the decisions about how to handle unexpected events and road conditions, and would do the braking and steering and everything.  It\u2019s kind of like having a flying car that is in control of everything, and you just decide where you want to go.

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: How do home vacuums work?\n\nAssistant: Some home vacuums have a little bristling brush that brushes across the carpet to pick up dirt, dust, and other particles.  The vacuum can be connected to a hose that goes outside, so that the dust and dirt can be sucked outside.  Inside, the dust and dirt are carried into a removable bag.  Usually, it\u2019s easy to get these bags replaced, so that vacuuming can be done on a regular schedule, since the bags will fill up over time.  If you have a hardwood floor in your house, you\u2019ll have to vacuum carefully to avoid scratching the floor.\n\nHuman: What are all the parts inside a vacuum?\n\nAssistant: Vacuums usually have a main fan that pulls air out of the vacuum, then there\u2019s the motor that turns the fan.  Then there\u2019s the dust collection bag, which collects the dust and dirt, and is sometimes known as the \u201cbag\u201d.  Other parts include bristles or a brush that moves the dust into the collection bag, the collection bag holder, a hose that brings air in and out of the vacuum, and the electrical wires that provide power to the vacuum.\n\nHuman: Is there a belt in a vacuum? I remember a burning rubber smell coming from a vacuum once.\n\nAssistant: You may be thinking of a floor vacuum, which can be used for cleaning carpets.  These tend to have a rubber belt that takes in the carpet fibers.  The rubber belt is heated to make it more efficient at picking up dirt.  This is often called a \u201cheat and dirt\u201d belt.  The heat and dirt belt is then pulled to the vacuum with the rest of the dirt from the floor.  Vacuums can have an electric motor or a gasoline engine, and the motor or engine powers the belt as well.  Floor vacuums have a hose that you can hook to another part of the vacuum to suck up the dirt.  It\u2019s good to make sure that the hose isn\u2019t kinked, so that the vacuum will work right.\n\nHuman: Is a broken vacuum easy to fix myself or will I have to take it to a company to fix it?\n\nAssistant: A vacuum cleaner is a relatively simple machine, but it\u2019s also easy to accidentally break it.  The bristles can become damaged or broken, or the main brush that collects dirt and dust can break or fall apart.  Most vacuums don\u2019t have moving parts, but they can still break down.  Often if a vacuum breaks it\u2019s because it wasn\u2019t properly taken care of.  However, the parts are simple enough that sometimes you can repair them yourself.  But if you don\u2019t have the technical skills, or your vacuum is complicated, it\u2019s often a good idea to take the vacuum to a repair shop or professional company.\n\nHuman: And how does a vacuum keep the dust and dirt from just spewing out into the air?\n\nAssistant:", "chosen": " The bag acts as a filter, which catches the dirt and dirt.

Some examples include Twitter, Google+, Instagram, and Pinterest.  However, many of them have some key differences in features.  For example, on Twitter you might post short messages to other users, whereas on Instagram you might post photos or videos.  If you click on an Instagram URL, you will not see these photos and videos, you would just be directed to the Instagram website.

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: How do I make a nice place for a rabbit to live?\n\nAssistant: Well, here\u2019s one approach I\u2019ve heard about before.  A human named Roger likes to use an unused aquarium to make a home for a rabbit.  He puts newspaper on the bottom, then sticks grass and pebbles around the edge.  A little dirt goes in the center, and a bit of plywood goes on top.  There\u2019s a small hole in the center where the rabbit can go in and out.  In winter, he sets a lamp inside the box, and the rabbit just snuggles up next to it.  This keeps the rabbit warm.\n\nHuman: That sounds nice!  What can I put in a cage to make a rabbit more comfortable?\n\nAssistant: Oh, that\u2019s a tricky question.  Here\u2019s what I\u2019ve read: Rabbits like to have dark places and places with lots of light.  They enjoy climbing and are curious.  You might also try putting things in a box for them to enjoy.  You could put out hay or straw, for example, or a ball of something that they can explore.  What do you think?\n\nHuman: I like that idea.  I will put a blanket over half of it so it's dark.

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: I just bought a puppy but I already have an older cat at home.  What is the best way to introduce the puppy to my cat?\n\nAssistant: Great question!  A good way to do that is to first get the older cat used to the smell of the new puppy so it knows that a new pet is coming.  The first step is to gently carry the puppy around and get the cat used to the puppy.  You should do this for about an hour each day, and then increase to multiple times a day.  The cat will need time to get used to the smell, but it\u2019s actually very easy!\n\nHuman: Should I try to keep the animals separated in the house for a few days so they each get used to each other's scent?\n\nAssistant: Sure!

What do I do if my cat gets aggressive with the puppy?\n\nAssistant: It\u2019s pretty unlikely that they will fight but if they do I recommend having the older cat locked up in a room with you and the puppy just walking by outside the room.

You\u2019d control the robot, and the robot would control the car.  If you wanted to be super safe, you could build an extra sensor in the car that would only drive in the safest conditions, and when there were hazards, or if the car sensed the driver wasn\u2019t doing what they should, then the robot would actually take over control of the car and drive it instead.  This is the safer way, but it would also be kind of slow because the robot would just be doing the exact same thing that you would have done, and if you messed up, the robot would also mess up.\n\nThe other way is to give your car a super powerful computer, with artificial intelligence, and a pretty fast internet connection, and let it drive itself.  This car would also have some sensors, but it wouldn\u2019t really need them, because it would always have access to so much more information than you do.  When you are driving, you would choose where you want to go, and your car would use all of its data to come up with the best route and way to get there.  The computer would make all the decisions about how to handle unexpected events and road conditions, and would do the braking and steering and everything.  It\u2019s kind of like having a flying car that is in control of everything, and you just decide where you want to go.  Most people use cars like this, because they\u2019re pretty good and most of the time you don\u2019t really want to do all of that work and risking making a mistake.", "chosen_initial": " The vehicle\u2019s sensors can sense where it\u2019s at and where it\u2019s going. Based on that, the vehicle can use all the sensors to determine where it should be able to travel. So, for example, if sensors told it was at the front of the parking lot, the automatic system should be able to tell the vehicle to turn left because that is the most direct route.", "chosen_selfr": "Why does it matter so much?  What features of this car make you want it over an already super complex car such as your own?\n\nThe advantage to this over the other solution is that there would be nothing to accidentally break.  You could replace the tire, and you could also replace any minor part on the car without having to get a part at some far off remote part of the world; because all of the parts are on board, and could be replaced by simply taking the car to a garage that can repair the car.\nSome things to also think about are safety, and the cost of the repairs and parts: what resources would you need to get repair services? how long would it take", "chosen_gptsemantic": "An alternative approach is to equip your vehicle with a highly advanced computer system, incorporating artificial intelligence and a high-speed internet connection, and allow it to operate autonomously. This vehicle would be equipped with sensors, although they may not be essential, as it would consistently have access to a vast amount of information beyond your reach. When you give directions while driving, the car would leverage its data to determine the optimal route and method of reaching the destination. The computer would take charge of handling unexpected circumstances and road conditions, managing braking, steering, and other functions. Essentially, it resembles having an automated flying vehicle overseeing all operations while you simply specify your destination. This type of vehicle is commonly used as it is quite reliable, and most of the time, individuals prefer not to engage in the laborious task of driving and risking potential errors.", "chosen_gptformat": "One possible approach to consider is this: You could create a car that operates without any human involvement in a variety of innovative ways.", "rejected": " The safety of autonomous cars is a very controversial topic right now.  As a car moves along a road, it\u2019s constantly receiving information from its sensors: can it see nearby traffic, or other road users?  And it\u2019s constantly receiving information from its GPS system: what is the speed limit in this location, where are the red lights?  And it\u2019s always making decisions: how fast should it go?  Does it have the right-of-way?  The driver is an important part of all of this decision-making, but it\u2019s one of the most challenging areas of technology.  Autonomous cars are often compared to flying an airplane, where you just get on and have your fun, and there\u2019s a crew in charge.  The computers do the hard work of flying.  But you can\u2019t just look at something and tell if it\u2019s safe to drive.  There\u2019s always a tradeoff.  For example, we can take a picture of an intersection and see how many cars have stopped there at different times, and then estimate how many cars are likely to arrive in the future.  But no image will ever be able to tell you exactly how many cars will be in an intersection at any given time, because each car is in motion, and each driver is different and can change his or her mind in the moment.  In the end, the computer is probably making hundreds of judgments, some of them simple, and some of them incredibly complicated.  And humans make judgments too.  That\u2019s why the driver needs to be paying attention, and must still be able to see clearly, and still must have his or her own ideas about what to do.", "reject_gptsemantic": "The safety of self-driving vehicles is currently a highly debated issue. As a vehicle travels on a roadway, it continuously gathers data from its sensors to assess nearby traffic and road users. The GPS system provides information on the speed limit and location of traffic signals. The vehicle is constantly making decisions, such as determining its speed and right-of-way. While the driver plays a crucial role in decision-making, it remains a complex aspect of technology. Comparisons are often drawn between autonomous vehicles and airplanes, where passengers trust the crew to handle the technical aspects of flying. However, assessing the safety of driving cannot be solely based on visual cues. There are always trade-offs involved. For instance, analyzing images of an intersection to predict future traffic patterns is helpful, but it cannot predict the exact number of cars present due to the dynamic nature of driving and individual drivers' behavior. Ultimately, the computer system makes numerous decisions, ranging from simple to highly intricate, while human drivers also contribute to the decision-making process.

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: I see that some countries have really nice high speed railway systems. The US has been trying, but can't seem to keep up. Why?\n\nAssistant: I'm really sorry to hear that, it's such a waste of money.  If only the private sector could be responsible for its own investment in infrastructure.  But of course, private companies will only build things if there's a profit to be made, and the country doesn't seem to value this public good enough.\n\nHuman: That sounds about right.

If we prioritize transportation for the greater good, it requires the government to tax people more for services that benefit the entire population, and pay for these services with this money.  That sounds reasonable, since the value of private companies should not override the value of human lives, and most governments are very responsive to public opinion.\n\nHuman: So true.

For a small part of that mechanism, there are two endogenous receptors for dopamine that work by binding to the neurotransmitter and transporting it elsewhere in the body.  Without these two receptors, dopamine is either bound to the cell membrane or transported to the synaptic space of other neurons, which also bind to and transport it away from the transmitter in their own way.  In the \u201cboost dopamine levels\u201d sense, one could just change the \u201cenvironment\u201d so that a greater number of these neurotransmitters are released, but this won\u2019t actually change the amount of the transmitter that is bound to the receptors.", "chosen_initial": " Oh, one of them is, I used to always feel like it was the end of the world when I had to do schoolwork, like do algebra, or do any math for long.

This makes your liver less efficient at processing other things, and over time it can get tired.  When your liver gets tired, you have more toxins in your body, and your immune system doesn\u2019t work as well.

It\u2019s difficult to trace the origins of closing stores on Sunday, but one early and short-lived attempt at forcing the Sabbath on people in the 1800s was motivated by the Protestant ideal that people should spend Sunday focusing on spiritual activities.  By the mid-1800s, when the Sunday closing law was made, there was not a lot of pressure from that standpoint, but the church had begun to advocate for Sunday closing laws as a way of counteracting the negative effects of industrialization on the day of rest.  Even after that shift, closing stores on Sunday was not always possible, since the religious Sunday was not always chosen for observance.  And as industrialization accelerated and mechanization made it possible to operate stores on Sunday, the law was not enforced as much as people liked.

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: How do I keep pipes from freezing in the winter?\n\nAssistant: When cold air enters your house, it contracts and this pulls heat out of your pipes.  If you open the valve of your water heater enough, the water will stay warm and flowing to your faucets, radiators and other appliances, so that your pipes don\u2019t freeze.  Unfortunately, this means you\u2019ll also use more water than you\u2019re used to.  As an alternative, you can insulate your pipes and heat them directly, so they remain warm even if your house is cold.  Here\u2019s some helpful advice for DIY insulation, but check with an expert before you do anything.\n\nHuman: How do I insulate the pipes?\n\nAssistant: If you\u2019re able to work with some mechanical skills, you could build a water heater insulator yourself.  You\u2019ll need a plastic sheet, a layer of foam insulation, and some baffles (pipe-shaped objects) and mounting hardware to hold everything together.  If you\u2019d rather not do that, you can hire a professional to do the work for you.\n\nHuman: What other methods can I use to keep the pipes from freezing?\n\nAssistant: There are other approaches to the problem, which don\u2019t involve the insulation of the pipes.  One approach is to use a booster heater to raise the temperature of the water coming out of your faucets and other appliances, even when the weather is cold.  You can purchase this from your local plumbing store, or from another hardware store.  This will be more expensive than insulation, but will also involve less work.\n\nHuman: Thank you.\n\nAssistant:", "chosen": " You\u2019re welcome.", "chosen_initial": "ectric space heater or propane heater, or if the space is very cold for even a short time of the day, then you will likely need a boiler.\n\nWhen do you need a boiler?", "chosen_selfr": "@\n\nThe use of @ (at) character with the sentence \u2018You\u2019re welcome.\u2019 above is redundant & confusing.", "chosen_gptsemantic": "My pleasure.", "chosen_gptformat": "Certainly, no problem at all.", "rejected": " You\u2019re welcome.

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: My hair is starting to get thinner. Is there any way to slow this down so I don't go bald?\n\nAssistant: Your body needs to replace cells, especially hair cells. The hair cells in your scalp are constantly being shed and replaced. This happens continuously, but it is usually a very slow process, and is not visible as hair is lost. This can happen at any time. But, it does depend on many different things, including age, gender, and nutrition.\n\nHuman: Is there a way to slow down the process of male pattern baldness?\n\nAssistant: It is possible to slow down the process of hair loss. We call this process of your hair changing the \u201canagen phase.\u201d Anagen means that you are in the growth phase of your hair. During this growth phase, you do not necessarily lose hair, but your hair does become finer, and thinner. The hair can stay this way for a period of time, which may extend your time without thinning hair or hair loss. However, this is not permanent, and your hair will begin the \u201ccatagen phase,\u201d which is where hair falls out. Also, there is no guarantee that your hair will not continue to thin, and if it does, there is not any way to stop it. However, if your hair stays thicker for more time, it can give you a longer time without hair loss, and therefore give you more time to accept this without feeling as upset.  \nAdditionally, there are things that you can do to slow the process of hair loss. This is important because it will give you time to get used to the idea of hair loss, or at least make you feel more in control of the process, and feel less stressed about it.

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: Why is the sky blue?\n\nAssistant: Blue is the color of light with the shortest wavelengths, between the violet end and the green end of the spectrum.  That part of the spectrum is more easily absorbed by water in the atmosphere.  That means that it is not scattered as much by the atmosphere and gets to us directly, without having to reflect off of dust and other objects.  That makes it the brightest color of light.\n\nHuman: What is Rayleigh scattering?\n\nAssistant: Rayleigh scattering is the process by which light interacts with gas atoms and molecules, and is responsible for creating the blue color of the sky.  Atoms and molecules interact with light because it has a property called \u201cmomentum\u201d and the atoms have an amount of \u201ckinetic energy\u201d that will be transferred to the light and change the path of the light as it goes through the atmosphere.\n\nHuman: I wonder what color the sky really is.\n\nAssistant: If you were to look at the sky in a wavelength that didn\u2019t interact with the atmosphere, you might see a dark sky, as it would not have been scattered.  Some astronomers have thought about this and produced pictures of what the stars would look like in that situation, where the light is unscattered.\n\nHuman: So do we really live in darkness>\n\nAssistant: The Earth is illuminated by sunlight, but if there weren\u2019t water in the atmosphere, it would also be lit by starlight.  The earth is not, in fact, shrouded in darkness, and there are dark spots in the light.\n\nHuman: Do you think color is subjective?\n\nAssistant: Our perception of colors is definitely subjective.

This is the case in cases where the object is transparent, not the case of transparent object that is being illuminated.\nCan someone explain to me why the words \"it is being reflected at us\" should be added to the original sentence?\nTo clarify, the original sentence in question is saying \"in all cases where the object has transparency,  an observer perceives the color of the object to be the color of the object's illumination.\" Can someone prove that it is necessary to add \"at us\" if not for an observer who views the object from inside the object?\n\nA:\n\nThe sentence is perfectly understandable.

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: What is Watergate scandal?\n\nAssistant: To understand the Watergate scandal, we should start with the election of Richard Nixon as president of the United States in 1968.  It was Nixon\u2019s second time being elected to the presidency, having first won in 1960, after John F. Kennedy\u2019s assassination.  But Nixon\u2019s election also sparked protests from Americans protesting Vietnam War, civil rights, and the effects of the war on the economy.  In this political environment, Nixon began the administration known as the \u201cGreat Silence\u201d, a period where he didn\u2019t talk about the issues facing the nation and didn\u2019t hold press conferences.  So while there was a strong opposition to his administration, there was no reliable record of what the Nixon administration actually believed and what actions it was taking.\n\nHuman: Was Nixon personally involved in the scandal?\n\nAssistant: Many scandals surrounded the Nixon administration.  The \u201cWatergate scandal\u201d is one in particular that involved a number of burglars breaking into the Democratic National Committee offices in the Watergate office complex in Washington D.C. during the 1972 presidential election.  One of the burglars was arrested and revealed a number of links between himself and the White House, which involved a conspiracy to cover up evidence of the Watergate break-in.  As it turned out, the burglary was committed by Nixon\u2019s reelection committee, and evidence found in Nixon\u2019s own handwriting was discovered that related to the Watergate burglary.  Nixon\u2019s involvement in the scandal was the issue that finally forced him to resign from the office of the president in 1974.\n\nHuman: Was Nixon a good president otherwise?\n\nAssistant:", "chosen": " Nixon\u2019s election was considered a political comeback for him, after his defeat in the 1960 election to John F. Kennedy.  He was well liked by many, for his administration which was praised for its intelligence and diplomatic progress, but also for his policy of d\u00e9tente with the Soviet Union.  Nixon\u2019s term was also marked by major policy achievements, including the Apollo 11 lunar mission, desegregation of the schools, the 1973 oil embargo, the \u201cNixon Shock\u201d in 1971, and a large increase in the number of college graduates.

What I\u2019m thinking of is the way that our imagination works.\n\nImagine you had a thin sheet of flexible plastic which could be pulled out from a roll to become a long tube, about 100m long.  We call this a \u201cwormhole\u201d, as in, it\u2019s a flexible wormhole.  If you were floating in space, and grabbed one end of it and held it, then the other end would stretch to the ground, into the ground and back out again.  If you stood on the ground, you could then pull it and have it lift you up into the air.  The question is, could the Earth rotate under the \u201cwormhole\u201d while the person holding it was \u201cin the air\u201d?\n\nThe answer is, no.  The \u201cwormhole\u201d analogy is a bit strange, so let me explain it more carefully.\n\nI think when you are floating above the ground, you are also moving around it.  But in the same way that you can hold one end of the wormhole while floating, the Earth is also moving around you.  So you might wonder how it could \u201crotate\u201d while you are also moving around it.\n\nThis is a situation of accelerating motion.  A spaceship, say, accelerates around the Earth so that it is moving at a speed which is near the speed of light.  As it flies past, we say it moves \u201cfaster than light\u201d and we call this \u201ctachyonic motion\u201d or \u201ctachyons\u201d for short.  Tachyons are things that accelerate faster than light, and as they pass by, objects may seem to move or \u201crotate\u201d as they pass, even though the objects themselves are not moving.\n\nI hope this answer has helped to clarify how we can still see the Earth rotating even if it is also accelerating in the other direction.

I would recommend trying the National Museum of American History, the National Air and Space Museum, or the National Museum of Natural History.  For the National Museum of American History, I would recommend the First Ladies exhibit, which features first ladies who played important roles in history.  For the National Air and Space Museum, I would recommend the special exhibit for 2019, \"Flight: 50 Years of Aviation in the National Air and Space Museum\", which will feature photographs and artifacts from the museum\u2019s archives.  For the National Museum of Natural History, I would recommend the dinosaur exhibition, which will feature full-scale reproductions of the many kinds of dinosaurs.

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: What are the pros and cons of lithium batteries? I hear, for example, lithium typically degrades erratically.\n\nAssistant: The biggest pros are a high-energy-density and very long lifespan. The cons are a high initial cost, low cycle life, and some safety concerns. For example, LiPo batteries have a risk of an internal thermal runaway that results in a rapid combustion of the battery and violent release of the flammable lithium hydroxide/lithium metal that are the byproducts of its electrochemical reactions. So it\u2019s great to use them in situations where these hazards are acceptable. This is commonly the case for flashlights. But if you\u2019re the consumer, you\u2019ll want to be sure that you\u2019re buying LiPo batteries from a manufacturer that actually tests its product for safety. Another thing to consider is that since the chemical reaction in LiPo batteries causes it to decompose to lithium metal, and a little of that metal can cause fires, you\u2019ll also want to take care not to discharge it down to a very low voltage or to handle it in conditions that would cause it to heat up a lot.\n\nHuman: I'm not sure all of the technical jargon you used was accurate, but I've also heard of some dangers associated with lithium batteries.

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: Is it true that if you lose any of your hearing, you can't get it back?\n\nAssistant: Well, hearing is a pretty complicated thing.  Your brain processes all sorts of information you get from your eyes, your nose, and your ears.  So if a person has damage to their auditory nerves, or to a part of their brain that processes sound, they will most likely lose some of the ability to hear, and possibly for the rest of their life.\n\nHuman: So there is no way to fix damage to nerves in our body?

Is this a temporary tattoo or a permanent one? What colors are you interested in? And how big do you want it to be?\n\nHuman: It will be an arm tattoo with color. That's all I know right now. How will they create the tattoo?\n\nAssistant: In order to get a tattoo, a person will first need to talk with a professional artist. They will go over your ideas and they will draw up a design and finalize the details. They will need to approve any final design before the tattoo is completed. This is so they are in compliance with any regulations for health and safety, and so they are aware of how the tattoo may cause additional complications in the future. The artist will then choose the specific skin area they want to tattoo, where the skin is soft and not fragile. There are two choices for the placement of a tattoo: \u201cspot-on-flesh\u201d placement or \u201cfreehand\u201d placement. For spot-on-flesh placement, the artist will first apply a special solution called a \u201cretainer\u201d which is designed to draw out the pigment from the tattoo. The artist will then outline the tattoo using a \u201ctransfer paper\u201d to ensure that the color transfer is as accurate as possible. The artist will then tattoo the desired design using a small \u201cneedle\u201d that injects ink into the skin. For freehand placement, the artist will just draw the tattoo directly on the skin using special ink and a needle, without a transfer paper.\n\nHuman: That helped me to learn a lot.

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: How do you change a man's organ to a woman?\n\nAssistant: I think that means \u201cchange a man\u2019s penis into a vagina\u201d. That\u2019s not really something that can be done. There\u2019s nothing magical about penises that could be swapped for vaginas. Perhaps you were thinking of gender reassignment surgery, but that has more to do with the psychology and body image of the person being transformed, not so much the anatomical details. If you like I can explain that.\n\nHuman: Please do enlighten me about it.\n\nAssistant: People choose gender reassignment surgery for a variety of reasons, but the most common include that they want to look like the gender that they feel they are, or to fit in with society\u2019s expectations. Gender reassignment surgery involves one of two options: either surgery to make the genitals look a certain way, or surgery to block or reverse the hormones that make the genitals look male. If you decide to go with the surgery to make your genitals look different, the \u201cnew\u201d genitals have to be made by taking skin from somewhere else on the body, and then surgically attaching it to the existing genitals. The surgery itself doesn\u2019t just change a penis into a vagina, it also changes a lot of other things about your body. So it\u2019s hard to imagine how the surgery could just make a penis into a vagina, without a lot of other changes.\n\nHuman: Are there any bad side effects for someone who had that surgery when he gets old?\n\nAssistant: It\u2019s hard to predict exactly what the results will be. With the surgery to make genitals look different, if it\u2019s successful, the results can be pretty good, and very successful surgeries can look pretty good. However, a \u201cfailed\u201d surgery can have some very disappointing and upsetting results, so you have to be careful what you\u2019re getting into. There are also potential dangers to the surgery itself. Some surgeries to make genitals look different involve removing normal body parts, and replacing them with fake body parts that aren\u2019t quite as well-made or strong, which can lead to complications. Overall I think surgery to make genitals look different is an extreme and risky decision, and one I wouldn\u2019t recommend.\n\nHuman: I see. Thanks.\n\nAssistant:", "chosen": " You\u2019re welcome.

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: My son (who is eight) is having a very hard time dealing with the death of his grandfather (my partner's father). The death was somewhat sudden and it's his first experience dealing with something like this (besides losing a pet once). He is confused, doesn't understand why he won't see Grandpa again, and I don't know what to say about it or how much I should say.\n\nAssistant: I can imagine this is a confusing and emotional time for you both, and that it can be difficult to find the right words. I can also imagine that it\u2019s a time where you need to reach out for support from others. I'm here to listen and help in any way that I can.\n\nHuman: Thank you. What should I say about the larger issue of passing away? When we've talked about it, he starts asking me if everyone will pass away? I want to be truthful but I don't want to scare him. And frankly it makes me kind of uncomfortable to talk about it too much, too. :)\n\nAssistant: It's understandable that you're both struggling. It can be difficult to talk about dying when you're already feeling sad and upset, but it can also be helpful to talk about it in a way that helps you cope. For your son it might also be good to just talk about the time and the memories he had of his grandpa.\n\nHuman: Yes, that's a good approach. But I know he'll ask me about the particulars as well, like \"Where did Grandpa go?\" and \"Will I see him again?\" I don't know how to answer those questions because I don't know the answer to them myself.\n\nAssistant: It might be hard for your son to understand right now, but over time it will become clearer that death is not really \u201ca place\u201d that we go to, but rather a change in our bodies. Death is very much like sleep in this respect. Sometimes we talk about it in terms of \u201cgoing to heaven,\u201d and we can talk about that sort of thing with your son, but we shouldn't worry too much about being \u201caccurate\u201d about that. Instead, we can talk about how after your grandpa\u2019s body dies, you will no longer be able to talk to him. It sounds like it might also be a good time to reflect on the quality of your relationship with him, and the ways you might feel like you\u2019ll miss him.\n\nHuman: Good points and good perspective. I think emphasizing that Grandpa is in our hearts still is comforting to him. I don't want to discuss heaven because I don't know if I believe in that and I don't want to plant false seeds in his mind at this young age. I don't want him thinking about this stuff at all, but I suppose that's out of my control.\n\nAssistant: That's a challenging situation! It can be helpful for your son to understand the larger context of what's happening, but it's also important to balance that against giving him the information he needs. I can imagine that you want to do what's best for your son, and I also think it's important to consider what you yourself believe and think.  For your own sake, I would encourage you to think deeply about your own belief systems and what you want to impart to your son.\n\nHuman: I agree with you. I think my belief system is just that I don't know and maybe that's just what I should say to him.

The inflation rate, which measures the rate at which prices are rising, is called the \u201cinflation rate\u201d.\n\nHuman: And what is the difference between inflation and hyperinflation? what causes inflation to go to hyperinflation?\n\nAssistant:", "chosen": " OK, so the key difference is that inflation is how prices are changing, while hyperinflation is the acceleration of inflation.  \n\nWhen inflation accelerates, it often leads to hyperinflation, but there are other conditions that can lead to hyperinflation, including extremely high government deficits and extremely high foreign exchange reserves.", "chosen_initial": " Well, technically, if your economy is experiencing hyperinflation, your money (and/or money supply) is constantly shrinking.

This increases the value of the same set of products in different ways because the more money people have, the more things they want to buy or sell. As the money supply expands and people's incomes are adjusted or their prices rise to match, prices change to reflect the changed incomes. Inflated currencies are more flexible than normal currencies, for example in that they can adjust quickly enough to remain in line with the real value of the asset they are pegged to, instead of having their purchasing power adjusted over months or a year, etc.\n\nA:\n\nThe link is pretty long, so I'll just post some parts, and then suggest what you can write from there:\n\nInflation causes high rates of change in prices that can become dangerous.

As the molecules return to normal, they push against the fabric and create a gentle pulling force that makes the balloon rise.  Likewise, as the air inside the balloon cools and contracts, it also pulls against the fabric, so the balloon slowly returns to the ground.

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: What is a spiritual channeler?

I gather these are just gross generalizations about psychics?\n\nAssistant: No, I stated a few actual ways in which people can be mistaken about what they think they channel, or be mistaken in assuming that they have received information from another spirit.\n\nHuman: Seems like a computer program might find it very threatening, to consider there is feminine spiritual power, that knows things, without any method physically, through intuition.
